# Post View and Interaction Updates

## Overview
This document outlines the updates made to the post viewing section to implement proper privacy controls and functional like/comment features.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Post Model (`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`)
- Added `likedUsers` and `commentsList` properties to track user interactions
- Implemented `Post.fromMap()` factory constructor for service integration
- Added `toMap()` method for data persistence
- Created `copyWith()` method for immutable updates

### 2. Privacy-Based Post Visibility
- **All Posts Tab**: Shows only public posts from all users
- **My Posts Tab**: Shows all posts (public and private) from the current user
- Posts are filtered based on `isPublic` property and `authorId`

### 3. Functional Like System
- Users can like/unlike posts by tapping the heart icon
- Like state is persisted using `SharedPreferences` via `PostService`
- Visual feedback: liked posts show red heart and bold text
- Like count updates in real-time

### 4. Functional Comment System
- Users can add comments by tapping the comment icon
- Comments are stored with username and timestamp
- Comment count updates in real-time
- Comments are persisted using `SharedPreferences`

### 5. Service Integration
- Integrated with existing `PostService` for data persistence
- Integrated with `AuthService` for user identification
- Posts are loaded asynchronously with loading indicators
- Pull-to-refresh functionality for updating posts

### 6. Enhanced User Experience
- Added refresh button in header
- Loading indicators while fetching posts
- Proper error handling with user feedback
- Timestamp formatting (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago")
- Post content truncation with ellipsis

## Technical Implementation

### Post Data Structure
```dart
class Post {
  final String id;
  final String title;
  final String description;
  final String authorName;
  final String authorAvatar;
  final String timestamp;
  final int likes;
  final int comments;
  final bool isPublic;
  final String authorId;
  final List<String> likedUsers;
  final List<String> commentsList;
}
```

### Key Methods
- `_loadPosts()`: Loads posts based on current view (All Posts vs My Posts)
- `_toggleLike()`: Handles like/unlike functionality
- `_addComment()`: Handles comment addition via dialog
- `_filteredPosts`: Getter that filters posts based on privacy settings

### Data Persistence
- Posts are stored using `SharedPreferences` via `PostService`
- Like states and comments are persisted per post
- User identification uses `AuthService.getCurrentUser()`

## Usage

### Creating Posts
1. Tap the floating action button (+)
2. Fill in title and content
3. Toggle privacy setting (Public/Private)
4. Tap "Publish Post"

### Viewing Posts
- **All Posts**: Shows public posts from all users
- **My Posts**: Shows all posts from the current user

### Interacting with Posts
- **Like**: Tap the heart icon to like/unlike
- **Comment**: Tap the comment icon to add a comment
- **View Details**: Tap the post card to view full post

## Privacy Controls
